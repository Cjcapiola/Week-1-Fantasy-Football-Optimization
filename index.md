# Optimizing a Fantasy Football Team: A Data Science Approach
## Introduction and Motivations
With the 2023 NFL season quickly approaching, there is one thing on every "hardcore" football fans mind: Fantasy Football. Whether one is just playing for the thrill of the game, or has entered into a competitive league where a "buy-in" is on the line, Fantasy General Managers across the nation are pulling out all the stops in order to optimize their chances at winning big. 
I have entered a "money league" myself, for better or for worse only time will tell, where the potential to take home 240 dollars neccesitates a careful week by week strategy for setting my team up for success. While many GM's invest a lot of time and effort into drafting the most ideal team right out of the gate, I unfortunatley had to miss my own draft and attend classes at the University of Pennsylvania. Whether or not my league purposely scheduled the draft for a time where they knew I would be busy is unconfirmed, but I like to believe that they percieved my Fantasy Football prowess as a threat and tried to sandbag me with ESPN's autodraft system. Thats in the past. The best I can do is work with the team I was given and optimize each week.
This blog post aims to take a data-driven approach to optimize a fantasy football team, focusing on the PPR (Point Per Reception) league format.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
Data collection is the first step in the analysis. We used a mix of datasets, including a comprehensive dataset for the 2022 NFL season and manually sourced data for specific players.

Data Cleaning
Before diving into the analysis, the dataset was thoroughly cleaned and pruned to only include relevant metrics.

```python
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_excel('path/to/dataset.xlsx')

# Drop irrelevant columns
df.drop(['Irrelevant_Column1', 'Irrelevant_Column2'], axis=1, inplace=True)
```
This code snippet loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and removes irrelevant columns. The drop() method is used to get rid of columns that we do not need for this specific analysis.

Calculating Per-Game Stats
We then converted season-long statistics into per-game statistics to have a standardized measure for each player.

```python
# Calculate per-game statistics
df['PassingYards_PerGame'] = df['PassingYards'] / 18
df['RushingYards_PerGame'] = df['RushingYards'] / 18
```
This code snippet calculates per-game stats by dividing the total stats by the number of games in the 2022 season (18 games). This allows us to make fair comparisons between players.

Data Analysis: Scoring Projections
The main goal is to project the number of points each player will score in future games based on past performance.

```python
# Calculate fantasy points for passing yards
df['FantasyPoints_Passing'] = df['PassingYards_PerGame'] * 0.04
```
In this snippet, we calculate the fantasy points for passing yards based on the league's scoring settings, which award 0.04 points for each passing yard. Similar calculations were done for other scoring categories.

Results
Based on our calculations, we can estimate the number of fantasy points each player is expected to score in future games.

Key Findings:

Player X and Player Y are projected to be high-performing players.
Player Z is a risky choice due to his history of injuries.
Conclusion
Our data-driven approach provides a robust way to optimize a fantasy football team. While the projections are based on past performance, they offer valuable insights for future games.

Challenges and Learning Points
Data cleaning is time-consuming but crucial for accurate analysis.
Lack of comprehensive, official datasets required us to source data from multiple places, including fan-generated content.
Future Work
The model could be further improved by incorporating more dynamic factors like weather conditions, player health, and team strategies.
